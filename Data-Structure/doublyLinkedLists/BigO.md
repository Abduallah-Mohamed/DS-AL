### Doubly linked lists VS Singly Linked Lists

- Doubly linked lists are almost identical to singly linked lists except there is an additional pointer to previous node.
- Better than singly linked lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time.
- However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer.
